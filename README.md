## Windows protected your PC
The application might refuse to run because Windows will assume this is malicious.
<br>
The fix is pretty simple, click on `More Info` and click on `Run Anyway`
<br>
Is that safe? Yes, it is. Windows protects your PC because this is an unsigned executable from an external source. If you're feeling a little paranoid, you can build it yourself with the instructions below!

## Can I get banned?

Not likely. Unless you go around telling everyone you have an instalocker. Don't boast it or flaunt it and use it responsibly.

> [@deadly](https://github.com/deadly): With all programs like this, there is no guarantee that it's safe because using the VALORANT API in this manner is against Riot's Terms of Service. However, this program does not use an autoclicker to select the agent, read the game's memory, or change the game's files; therefore, the anticheat shouldn't be triggered. No suspensions have been reported so far from using this method of exploit. All things considered, I would use this only on an alt account if you don't want to risk the 7 day API abuse account suspension on your main, albeit unlikely.
